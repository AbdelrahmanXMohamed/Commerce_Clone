'''
    Models:
    Your application should have at least three models in addition to the User model: 
    
        1.for auction listings.
        2.for bids.
        3.for comments made on auction listings. 

    Itâ€™s up to you to decide what fields each model should have, 
    and what the types of those fields should be. 
    You may have additional models if you would like.
